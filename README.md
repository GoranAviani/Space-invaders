# Space Invaders

The year was 1978. Black-and-white game created by Tomohiro Nishikado came out. The game that would set the standard for shooters for years to come. That game was Space Invaders.


Space Invaders was one of the forerunners of modern video games, and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry. 
Technology journalist Jason Whittaker places the beginning of the golden age in 1978, with the release of Space Invaders.


Nishikado drew inspiration from games such as 
* Breakout
* Gun Fight

and science fiction stories such as
* The War of the Worlds 
* Space Battleship Yamato 
* Star Wars
